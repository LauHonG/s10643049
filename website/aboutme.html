							<p>I am LauHong, a boy that now is 20 years old. I am the boy that studied oversea. I came from Terengganu, Malaysia. My hobby is play basketball and also play computer games. My favorite foods in Malaysia is "Nasi Lemak", and also i have my favorite foods in Taiwan, that is stinky toufu. I decided to studied abroad all because of my parents wanted me to studied in this university, so i came here today to studied Internet Technology. I was very nervous because it was my first time going out from home for a long time, i go back my hometown once a year so that i very cherish the time i back home. This is my third year studied in Taiwan, I appreciate that many people, first that is my parents that bring me to this school. Second is my friends that I met in this school, they helped me a lot, include in homework or in sport. Third is I wanted to thanks the seniors who help me in my university life, they helped me about my work, and bringing me to be a responsible persons.   </p>
